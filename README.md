# Wazuh SOC Homelab – Detection Engineering Portfolio **Hands-on SOC Detection & Response Lab with Wazuh** A fully self-built Security Operations Center (SOC) homelab using Wazuh — an open-source SIEM and XDR platform. This project demonstrates end-to-end threat detection and response workflows in a realistic multi-OS environment, focusing on entry-level SOC analyst skills: log ingestion, alert triage, detection engineering, troubleshooting, and basic incident response. ![SSH Authentication Failure Spike](/screenshots/auth-failure-spike.png) *Wazuh Dashboard showing massive authentication failure spike during SSH brute-force simulation* --- ## Project Summary and Motivation As an aspiring cybersecurity professional targeting junior SOC analyst roles, I created this lab to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge (e.g., Microsoft SC-200/SC-300 coursework, Security+ certification) and hands-on experience that employers actually look for. This homelab replicates real SOC workflows: - Deploying and managing agents across Linux and Windows endpoints - Ingesting and enriching logs - Detecting attacks using stock and custom rules - Triaging alerts in the dashboard - Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK - Simulating incident response actions It highlights my ability to troubleshoot common production issues (agent connectivity, indexer performance, certificate errors, and configuration failures) — skills directly transferable to tools like Wazuh, Splunk, Elastic, or Microsoft Sentinel. Everything runs on **bare-metal personal hardware** (no VMs for the endpoints) to ensure authentic log behavior and network interactions. **Contact:** John Gill | Security+ (SY0-701) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessemcgeejr) --- ## Lab Architecture ![Lab Architecture Diagram](/screenshots/lab-architecture-diagram.jpg)
